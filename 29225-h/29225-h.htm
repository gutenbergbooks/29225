<p class="center">(1748-1816)</p>


<p>The battle of Bunker's Hill was an event which stirred whatever
dramatic activity there was in America at the time of the
Revolution. Therefore, a play written on the subject should not
be omitted from a collection supposed to be representative of
the different periods in American history and in American
thought. The reader has an interesting comparison to make in
Hugh Henry Brackenridge's play, which the title-page declares
is "A dramatic piece of five acts, in heroic measure, by a gentleman
of Maryland," and a later piece entitled "Bunker Hill, or
the Death of General Warren," written by John Daly Burk
(1776-1808), who came to America because of certain political
disturbances, and published his drama with a Dedication to
Aaron Burr (1797), the year it was given in New York for the
first time.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It will be found that the former play is conceived
in a better spirit, and is more significant because of the fact
that it was written so soon after the actual event.</p>

<p>It is natural that Hugh Henry Brackenridge should have been
inspired by the Revolution, and should have been prompted by
the loyal spirit of the patriots of the time. For he was the stuff
from which patriots are made, having, in his early life, been
reared in Pennsylvania, even though he first saw the light near
Campbletown, Scotland, in 1748. His father (who moved to
America in 1753) was a poor farmer, and Hugh received his
schooling under precarious conditions, as many boys of that
time did. We are given pictures of him, trudging thirty miles
in all kinds of weather, in order to borrow books and newspapers,
and we are told that, being quick in the learning of languages,
he made arrangements with a man, who knew mathematics, to
trade accomplishments in order that he himself might become
better skilled in the science of calculation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, he was so well equipped that he was
engaged to teach school in Maryland, at Gunpowder Falls, some
of his pupils being so much larger and older than he that, at one
time, he had to take a brand from the fire, and strike one of them,
in order to gain ascendency over him.</p>

<p>At eighteen, pocketing whatever money he had saved, he went
to President Witherspoon, of the College of New Jersey, arranging
with that divine to teach classes in order that he might afford
to remain and study. While there, among his classmates may
be counted James Madison, future president of the United States,
Philip Freneau, the poet, and others of later note. Aaron Burr
was a Junior at the time of Brackenridge's graduation, as was
William Bradford. Though he was on intimate terms with
Madison, he was much more the friend of Freneau, the two
writing together "The Rising Glory of America." Should one
take the complete piece, which was read by Brackenridge at
Commencement, and mark therein that part of the poem composed
by Freneau, and included later in Freneau's published
works, one might very readily understand that Brackenridge
was less the poet, even though in some ways he may have been
more versatile as a writer.</p>

<p>This piece, "The Rising Glory of America,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is representative
of a type of drama which was fostered and encouraged by the
colleges of the time. We find Francis Hopkinson, in the College
of Philadelphia, writing various dialogues, like his "Exercise:
Containing a Dialogue [by the Rev. Dr. Smith] and Ode, sacred
to the memory of his late gracious Majesty George II. Performed
at the public commencement in the College of Philadelphia,
May, 1761." Yet Hopkinson was one of the Signers
of the Declaration of Independence!</p>

<p>What says Abb&eacute; Robin, viewing Harvard in 1781:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Their pupils often act tragedies, the subject of which is generally
taken from their national events, such as the battle of Bunker's Hill,
the burning of Charlestown, the death of General Montgomery, the
capture of Burgoyne, the treason of Arnold, and the Fall of British
Tyranny. You will easily conclude that in such a new nation as
this, these pieces must fall infinitely short of that perfection to
which our European literary productions of this kind are wrought
up; but, still, they have a greater effect upon the mind than the
best of ours would have among them, because those manners and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
customs are delineated, which are peculiar to themselves, and the
events are such as interest them above all others. The drama is
here reduced to its true and Ancient origin.</p></div>

<p>Nathaniel Evans also wrote dialogues, performed at the public
Commencements in Philadelphia, like the one on May 17, 1763.
We have already noted that "The Prince of Parthia" was written
as a college play. "The Military Glory of Great Britain" was
also prepared as an entertainment by the graduates of the College
of New Jersey, held in Nassau-Hall, September 29, 1762, with
the authorship unknown. It was a type of play which tempted
many men, who later tried their hand at more important dramatic
work.</p>

<p>Another interesting title of the time ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An/Exercise,/containing/a Dialogue and Ode/On the Accession of
His present gracious Majesty,/George III./Performed at the public
Commencement in the College of/Philadelphia, May 18th, 1762./Philadelphia:/Printed
by W. Dunlap, in Market-Street, M,DCC,LXII./</p></div>

<p>In order to understand the spirit which prompted both Brackenridge
and Freneau, one needs must turn to an account of the
latter's life, and learn therefrom certain facts concerning the
early college spirit of Brackenridge, which was ignored by his
son in the only authentic record of his life we have.</p>

<p>From Freneau we understand, for example, that, as early as
June 24, 1769, a certain number of students banded themselves
into an undergraduate fraternity, called the American Whig
Society, the chief members of that association being Madison,
Brackenridge, Bradford, and Freneau himself. There is a manuscript
book in the possession of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
originally owned by Bradford, and containing some of
their later poetical tirades. It is called "Satires against the
Whigs," and is composed of ten pastorals by Brackenridge and
a number of satires by Freneau. It is strange that the intimacy
between Brackenridge and Freneau did not lead to their rooming
together while at College, Brackenridge giving way to James
Madison. But we do know that the two were very intimately
associated in early literary work, and, in the manuscript book
just mentioned, there is contained the fragment of a novel
written alternately by the two, and called "Father Bombo's
Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Then followed "The Rising Glory of America," which, when
Brackenridge graduated, September 25, 1771, was announced on
the program of events&mdash;afternoon division&mdash;as being entirely
by himself. This must have been an oversight, inasmuch as
Freneau had more than a mere hand in the execution of the
piece, and inasmuch as we possess Brackenridge's own confession
"that on his part it was a task of labour, while the verse of his
associate flowed spontaneously."</p>

<p>The college life of the time was not devoted entirely to literary
creativeness or to political discussions. There is published an
address by President Witherspoon to the inhabitants of Jamaica
(1772), in which he outlined the course of study to which the
students were subjected. It indicates, very excellently, the
classical training that Brackenridge, Freneau, and Madison had
to undergo. In fact, we find, on Commencement Day, Freneau
debating on "Does Ancient Poetry excel the Modern?" and
throwing all his energy in favour of the affirmative argument.
And Brackenridge, selected to deliver the Salutatory, rendered
it in Latin, "De societate hominum." (See Pennsylvania
<i>Chronicle</i>; John Maclean's "History of the College of New
Jersey," i, 312; Madison's correspondence while a student;
also Philip Vickers Fithian's Journal and Letters: 1764-1774.
Student at Princeton College: 1770-1772. Tutor at Nomini
Hall in Virginia: 1773-1774. Ed. ... by J. R. Williams. Princeton,
1900.) The Princeton historian points to this class of 1771
as being so patriotic that a unanimous vote was taken to appear
at graduation in nothing but things of American manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This much we do know regarding the early life of Brackenridge:
that he was always pressed for money, that it was his indefatigableness
and thirst for knowledge which carried him through the
schools of the time, and through college.</p>

<p>His son even confesses that his father was obliged, on one
occasion, to write an address which one of the students had to
deliver, and to receive in payment therefor a new suit of clothes!</p>

<p>It was after his graduation that Brackenridge tutored in the
College for a while, meantime taking up a course in theology.
After this, he accepted a position as teacher in a school on the
eastern shore of Maryland, because the "Academy" offered him
a most flattering salary, and he could not reject it, however much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
he may have been interested in his college work. No sooner was
he established there than he wrote to his friend, Freneau, inviting
him to take the second position in the Maryland Seminary.
This position was accepted by Freneau, who wrote to James
Madison on November 22, 1772, mentioning therein that
Brackenridge was at the head of Sommerset Academy, to which
he himself had come on October 18th of that year, and where
he was teaching the young idea and pursuing at the same time
his theological studies.</p>

<p>As illustration of how much Freneau was at heart in tune with
the work, we note that he says, "We have about thirty students
in this Academy who prey upon me like leeches."</p>

<p>According to Brackenridge's son, whose Memoir of his father
is published in the 1846 edition of "Modern Chivalry," there
must, however, have been in this part of Maryland a polished
social atmosphere, which gave ample opportunity for the wit,
the scholarship, and the conversational and social powers of
Brackenridge to develop.</p>

<p>For the students of Sommerset Academy, Brackenridge wrote
his play, "The Battle of Bunkers-Hill,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and though there is no
record of this piece having been actually presented, it is generally
agreed that the Principal wrote his drama as an exercise for the
pupils to perform. It was published anonymously, the fashion
of the day which has led to many disputes,&mdash;for example, as to
the authorship claims of John Leacock and Mrs. Mercy Warren.
Royall Tyler was likewise diffident about letting his name appear
on the title-page of "The Contrast."</p>

<p>When published in 1776, Brackenridge's piece was dedicated
to Richard Stockton, and its tone and temper are thoroughly
indicative of the spirit that must have dominated all his writings
while at College.</p>

<p>The year 1776 marks Brackenridge's severance from teaching
work. He soon after went to Philadelphia with his small fortune
of one thousand pounds, and continued his efforts to make a
livelihood by editing the <i>United States Magazine</i>, which afforded
him an opportunity of airing his patriotic views, and gave him
the added pleasure of inviting his associate, Freneau, to become
one of the leading contributors. The following year, even though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
he had never been ordained in the Church, Brackenridge, nevertheless,
a licensed divine, enlisted as Chaplain in the Revolutionary
Army, and there are extant a number of vigorous political
sermons which it was his wont to deliver to the soldiers&mdash;the
same fiery eloquence seen in his "Eulogium on the Brave Men
who fell in the Contest with Great Britain," delivered in 1778.</p>

<p>Some time elapsed while he travelled hither and thither with
a bible in his saddle-bags, according to description, and then
Brackenridge took up the study of law, inasmuch as his very
advanced views on religious questions would not allow him to
subscribe to all the tenets of his Presbyterian faith. This drew
down upon him the inimical strictures of the pulpit, but
marked him as a man of intellectual bravery and certain moral
daring.</p>

<p>Having completed his law reading in Annapolis, under Samuel
Chase, afterwards Supreme Court Judge, he crossed the Alleghanies,
in 1781, and established himself in Pittsburgh, where
he rapidly grew in reputation, through his personal magnetism
and his undoubted talents as a lawyer. He was strictly in
favour of the Federal Constitution, and those who wish to fathom
his full political importance should not only study his record as
Judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania, when
he was appointed by Governor McKean, but, more significant
still, the part he took in the Whiskey Insurrection, which brought
him in touch with Albert Gallatin. In accord with the temper
of the times, he was a man of party politics, although he never
allowed his prejudices to interfere with his duties on the bench.
As a Judge, his term of office ran from 1800 to the day of his
death, June 25, 1816.</p>

<p>Mr. Brackenridge, besides being the author of the dialogue
and play mentioned, likewise wrote several other dramas, among
them being a tragedy, "The Death of General Montgomery at
the Siege of Quebec" (1777), and a number of Odes and Elegies.
The historical student will find much material relating to Brackenridge's
political manoeuvres, in his book on the Western
Insurrection; but probably as an author he is more justly famous
for his series of stories and sketches published under the title,
"Modern Chivalry" (1792), and representing a certain type of
prose writing distinctive of American letters of the time of Clay
and Crawford. These impressions were later added to. It is a
type to be compared with the literary work done in the Southern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
States by J. J. Hooper, Judge Longstreet, and Judge Baldwin
in ante-bellum days.</p>

<p>Among Brackenridge's other works may be mentioned:</p>

<p>An account of Pittsburgh in 1786. (Pittsburgh <i>Gazette</i>, July
29, 1786. Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh: <i>Monthly Bulletin</i>,
1902, v., 257-262, 288-290, 332-335.)</p>
